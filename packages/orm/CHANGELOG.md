### What's Changed

- **upstream**: Starting from Prisma v5.17.0, the new RAW raw SQL protocol has been enabled.
- **$raw**: Now `$raw.query` returns the correct data type front, instead of `dynamic`.
- **$raw**: `$raw.execute` now returns the number of rows affected as an `int`.
- **docs**: Removed param from docs that are no longer supported by the Prisma CLI

#### QueryRaw performance improvements

We’ve changed the response format of queryRaw to decrease its average size which reduces serialization CPU overhead.

When querying large data sets, we expect you to see improved memory usage and up to 2x performance improvements.
